## Description

This exercise involved Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Working with a virtual representation of a Mercedes Benz card, the newly added functionality allows users to change the color of the car in the main photo and the 'add to cart' button by clicking on the corresponding color options. As well as adjustments to the HTML and CSS for added clarity and consistency, the card also now includes a pop-up alert for users to confirm that they want to proceed with their purchase after clicking on the 'add to cart' button. 

#### Technologies

- Visual Studio Code
- JavaScript
- Node
- Vitest


#### Testing

Testing involved checking for the appropriate title and an 'add to cart' button, as well as the necessary code to perform the color change operation. All tests passed. To perform these same tests, it is necessary to install Node.js and follow the guidelines on vitest.dev.
